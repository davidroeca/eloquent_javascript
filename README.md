## eloquent_javascript

This repository is used to store all code for the [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html) book.

The following code does not explicitly follow Eloquent JavaScript; it instead tries to follow the high-level conceptual level covered by Eloquent JavaScript, while aiming to follow best practices outlined by Douglas Crockford in [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf)
